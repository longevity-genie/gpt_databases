rs1042522	Participants (n = 9,219) of the Copenhagen City Heart Study were genotyped for the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism. Then the morbidity of 6 subtypes of cancer and mortality were assessed for each genotype.	The risk of hematologic cancer increased 2-fold in Arg/Pro heterozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes (p < 0.001), with a similar trend in Pro/Pro homozygotes. The overall 12-year survival after blood sampling was increased in Arg/Pro heterozygotes with 3% (p = 0.003) and in Pro/Pro homozygotes with 6% (p = 0.002) vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes. The cumulative 5-year mortality after a cancer diagnosis was reduced in Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes by 9% (p = 0.003) and 13% (p = 0.03). These results suggest a better prognosis in Arg/Pro heterozygotes and Pro/Pro homozygotes vs. Arg/Arg homozygotes after the diagnosis of cancer or other life-threatening disease.	18256523

A genome-wide cardiovascular disease candidate gene-centric association with sCD14 was conducted separately in the European-Americans (n=2952) and blacks (n=528). Finally, the ability of sCD14 and its main genetic determinants to predict incident CVD and mortality during follow-up was assessed.	sCD14 was positively correlated with cardio-metabolic risk factors and with subclinical measures of vascular disease, and was also inversely correlated with body mass index (all P<0.001). In European Americans the minor allele at the index SNP rs5744441 was associated with lower sCD14, the C allele of index SNP rs1063412 was associated with lower sCD14. In Blacks the index SNP rs778584 was associated with higher sCD14. In the fully adjusted model, sCD14 was associated with death because of cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio=1.13, P=0.001) and death because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio=1.11, P=0.001). CD14 independently predicts risk mortality in older adults. However, no SNPs were associated with risk of mortality when corrected for multiple hypothesis testing.	23162014

No association was found between genotypes and longevity or aging-related biologic, clinical or functional phenoypes after mutiple test correction.	24589862
rs11555236	Three SNPs in the SIRT3 gene were examined in 549 genomic DNA from Treviso Longeva study. A Cross-sectional analysis was carried out by comparing people over and under 85 years of age, followed by a longitudinal analysis considering mortality as the dependent variable.	Longitudinal analysis showed an association for rs4980329, rs11555236 in whole cohort and females (but cross-sectional analysis showed no association; see other entries from the same study). SIRT3 genetic variability might be relevant for the modulation of human longevity in the Italian population.	23839864

rs4964778	38 genes (311 SNPs) belonging to pro-antioxidant pathways were investigated for the association with physical and cognitive performances in a Cohort of 1089 Danish nonagenarians. For each gene analyzed in the pro-antioxidant pathway, the influence on longitudinal survival was tested.	NDUFS1, TXNRD1, SOD2 and UCP3 were found significantly associated with lifespan in the female cohort. This result is consistent with their associations with physical functioning and suggests that the variability of genes in the pro-antioxidant pathway can influence survival through an effect on physical performances, at least in the analyzed cohort.	24462499
